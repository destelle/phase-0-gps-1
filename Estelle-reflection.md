* the concepts that i was struggling with prior to the GPS session was the difference between add and touch
* add and touch were clarified for me, as well as deleting old branches
* i asked about shortcuts that i have seen been used and why i couldn't use them. Also i asked for clarifing detail for the merge conflict.
* the overall syntax style of git is still confusing as im used to java and c++. also the making sure i have good commit messages
* overall i would say my first GPS was very sucessful and i found it very helpful with my overall knowledge of git and github
